# 🌌 Fract-ol

Fract-ol is a real-time fractal visualization program written in **C**, allowing you to explore the fascinating world of mathematical fractals through interactive graphics.

## 🎯 The Purpose

The goal of this project is to **understand and visualize complex mathematical concepts** by generating well-known fractals in real time.

#### Through this project, you will:

- Learn how **complex numbers** behave under iterative functions

- Explore **mathematical chaos** and **infinite patterns**

- Practice **graphics programming** and event handling

- Optimize rendering for **real-time interaction**

#### The program currently supports the following fractals:

- 🌀 **Mandelbrot**

- 🌙 **Julia**

- 🔥 **Burning Ship**

Each fractal is rendered dynamically, allowing you to zoom, move, and modify parameters to better understand how small changes can lead to dramatically different patterns.

## 🧠 What Is a Fractal?

A **fractal** is a geometric object that exhibits:

- **Infinite detail**

- **Self-similarity** (exact or approximate)

- **Complex patterns** emerging from **simple rules**

Fractals are usually generated by **iterating a mathematical function** repeatedly and observing whether the values remain bounded or escape to infinity.

#### Example: Mandelbrot Set

The Mandelbrot set is defined by the recurrence relation:

```
zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c
```

Where:

`z` and `c` are **complex numbers**

The initial value of `z` is `0`

Each **pixel** represents a different **value** of `c`

Depending on how fast the sequence diverges (or if it doesn’t), we assign a color — creating the stunning visuals fractals are known for ✨

Fractals appear in:

- Nature 🌿 (ferns, coastlines, clouds)

- Physics ⚛️

- Computer graphics 🎮

- Finance 📈

## 🛠 How to Use
### 🔧 Compilation

Thanks to the **Makefile**, compiling the project is straightforward:
```bash
make
```

This compiles all necessary files. If the project is already compiled, only modified or missing files will be recompiled.
```bash
make clean
```

Removes all `.o` object files.
```bash
make fclean
```

Removes `.o` files **and** the executable.
```bash
make re
```

Runs `make fclean` followed by `make`.

### 🚀 How to Launch

#### Run the executable:
```bash
./fractol
```

You can then choose which fractal to display:

- `mandelbrot`

- `julia`

- `burning_ship`

#### Example:
```bash
./fractol mandelbrot
```
**Julia Set Parameters**

If you choose `julia`, you must provide **two additional parameters**:
the **real** and **imaginary** parts (×1000) of the complex number added in the iteration.

#### Example:
```bash
./fractol julia 230 675
```

This corresponds to:
```
z = z² + (0.23 + 0.675i)
```
### 🎮 Controls Inside the Program

Once the program is running:

#### 🧭 Navigation

Move with **W A S D** or **arrow keys**

Zoom with the **mouse scroll**

Zoom follows the mouse pointer 🖱️

#### 🎨 Visuals

Change color palette with **1** and **2**

#### 🔢 Julia Parameters (Live)

**Z** → decrease real part

**X** → increase real part

**C** → decrease imaginary part

**V** → increase imaginary part

#### 🔄 Switch Fractals

Remember when choosing the fractal at launch wasn’t that important? 😉

You can switch **live** between fractals using:

- **3**

- **4**
